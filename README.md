# Traffic-Node-Simulation

Improving the traffic performance of the node - Wilhelmst√§dter Platz, Stadtfeld Ost, Magdeburg, Germany.
A real-time simulation of the traffic was created, to observe changes such as addition of new lanes and pedestrian crossings, combining cross-arms, and signal optimisation, in order to improve overall traffic performance at the node.
